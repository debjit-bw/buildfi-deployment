# BuildFi: Decentralized Crowdfunding Platform for Developers

BuildFi is a revolutionary decentralized crowdfunding platform tailored specifically for developers, empowering them to raise funds for their projects from day one. By leveraging blockchain technology and innovative features, BuildFi facilitates transparent and efficient fundraising while prioritizing user credibility and project accountability.

## Features

### Crowd Investment

- Developers can commit a portion of their project's token to attract investors.
- Funds raised are disbursed in stages based on milestones set by the developer during project creation.

### User Credibility Verification (RISC-ZERO)

- Utilizes zero-knowledge proofs (zk-KYC) to verify the ownership of email addresses and wallet addresses.
- Verification steps include connecting the wallet, logging into a Gmail account, and using off-chain zk-provers provided by RISC-0.
- Once verified, investors can verify the authenticity and credibility of developers through linked platforms such as GitHub or LinkedIn.

### Irrevocable Proof (EthSign, Sign Protocol)

- Developers attest to starting the project after the funding deadline, providing an irrevocable on-chain proof or contract of the tokens they commit to investors.
- Investors receive tokens proportionate to their investment.

### Milestone Management and Voting

- Project creation includes milestone timestamps and payout percentages set by the developer.
- Each milestone undergoes voting by investors to judge completion, based on off-chain content published by the developer. A third-party verifier can also be utilized.
- Witness feature seamlessly blends the storage layer of web2 with the security of web3, ensuring efficient management of voting lists and maintaining data integrity.
